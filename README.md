# LobbySystem
Discontinued plugin of mc-protection.eu

This is a baisc, howver unieque hubcore. 
We will not be updating this plugin any further for now, this may* change in the future. 

PRs are accepted, so long they don't suck. 



Merits for the source publication:

LobbySystem users have noticed that we haven't updated LobbySystem for a long time, we simply haven't had or motivation to update it.
Therefor we think it would be benificial to opensource it, this way you are able to update it yourself, as mentioned we do accept PRs. LobbySystem from here on out will be 100% community driven.
